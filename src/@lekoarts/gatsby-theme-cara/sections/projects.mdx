<ProjectCard title="Gacho Style Magazine" link="https://github.com/mando-larry/Gacho-Style-Magazine" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
A digital art portfolio and magazine aesthetically designed by a San Antonio artist named Zerktronic. Using paired programing we utilized the Spring Framework and Bootstrap to create a responsive mobile experience. To handle image storage we created a UI that allows the artist to upload pictures to an Amazon S3 bucket. The api Flipsnack was used to showcase a digital version of a magazine the artist created.
